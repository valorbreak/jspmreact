# Troubleshooting
- `Cannot read property '_currentElement' of null` - Means you're running two versions of REACT.
Make sure react-router is using the same react library.

# Code Convention
- Check for existing object prototypes when creating a new object with new prototypes (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype)
- Always return after res.json() or equivalent - Prevent responding more than once

# Command Line
- Commander and Promptly are two different libraries
